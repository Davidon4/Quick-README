<!-- Short description of project if you want -->
Writing READMEs is way too hard,  With Quick-readme you can spend less time worrying about whether or not your initial documentation is good, and spend more time writing and using code.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Quick-README is designed for all types of libraries, Which it applies to all languages and package managers
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch:cry:

I'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks :heart::heart:

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
